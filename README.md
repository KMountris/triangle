# Triangle
A Two-Dimensional Quality Mesh Generator and Delaunay Triangulator.
By Jonathan Richard Shewchuk.

This repository is a copy of the popular Triangle library for two-dimensional quality mesh generation and Delaunay triangulation.
It is developed by Jonathan Richard Shewchuk from Computer Science Division of University of California at Berkeley

Triangle generates exact Delaunay triangulations, constrained Delaunay triangulations, conforming Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi diagrams,
and high-quality triangular meshes. The latter can be generated with no small or large angles, and are thus suitable for finite element analysis.
